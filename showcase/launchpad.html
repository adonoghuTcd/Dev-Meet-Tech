              The Dev, meet Tech LaunchPad event was run as a one day event on Friday 19th February 2016. For this event, <strong>17 student change makers</strong> came together on a Friday from a diverse range of backgrounds to develop new ways to use technology for good.
            </p>

            <p>
              We also had <strong>6 mentors</strong> to help guide the teams in their developments, and <strong>2 fantastic speakers</strong> to help set the scene for the day.
              After the speaker series, the cohort was split into groups and sent on their way to get developing.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Their results were insanely cool.</strong>
            </p>

              <p>
                Technology is all around us and holds huge potential to provoke positive changes. Dev, meet Tech was
                organized due to a trend that we've been seeing in the tech scene: we're not being exposed to the
                <strong>power that technology</strong> can have to provoke real positive social change. We realised that technology can be used to do good <strong>by anybody</strong>. All that's required is an innovative mind and some basic tech skills. From this we spawned the idea of <strong>Dev, meet Tech</strong>.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>60%</strong> of the cohort were non-tech students. This provided the teams on the day with lots of <strong>different outlooks</strong> to problems and how technology can be used to tackle them. We had a selection of <strong>business, poltics and art students</strong>, as well as tech students, who all brought their own skillsets and views on a wide range of issues in today's world.
              </p>
            </div>

              <p>
                For Dev, meet Tech, we tried to move away from traditional hackathon concepts (we even avoid using the word ”hackathon” because of its baggage). We did however still use regular ”hacking food”, like <strong>coffee and snacks :)</strong> In the morning we held a <strong>speaker series</strong> made up of three fantastic speakers who all provided the cohort with food for thought to set them up for the rest of the day.

                “It wasn't like a 'typical' hackathon, it was more than that.”
              </p>
            </blockquote>-->

            <p class="hypothesis">
              We have now showed for ourselves and the attendees of Dev, meet Tech that our hypothesis holds:
            </p>

            <p class="highlight">
              Students can make a real difference using technology
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Technology can empower anyone</strong> to provoke a positive change in this world. We hope to awaken students to this power and how it can be utilised to benefit today's world.

                Reduce, reuse, recycle. Technology has been used in innovative ways to tackle bother the reuse and recycle aspects of this cycle but what about the reduce?
              </p>
              <p>
                Reducing waste has become a hot topic with new laws in France and the ever growing stats on our waste. This idea involves adding a best before parameter to the data associated with food barcodes. Currently barcodes are mainly associated with a price and a name.
              </p>
              <p>
                This extra information will be very valuable to retail units in monitoring their waste. It may also be used to benefir consumers. For instance, a QR code may be generated and added to the consumer reciept. Scanning this reciept could add all of your food and their best before dates to a smart device app.

                Foster is a web application with the goal of helping get deprecated computers from industry to people
                in need. The amount of computers that get sold on for refabrication after use from companies like Intel is astounding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using this app, a time can be set up for when to collect the computers, they are then brought to a refurbishment
                company and from there, the app can also be used to distribute these newly refurbished machines to people who are
                most in need. These people will "foster" the newly refurbished machines.
